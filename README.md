# Elemental Card Game

**Card Elemental Battle** is a strategic card game built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Players utilize elemental-themed cards to battle against each other, with each player assigned an element that defines their strengths and weaknesses. The game runs on the terminal/console and requires players to strategically choose cards to attack or defend, with the goal of being the last player standing. The game features dynamic gameplay with varying card effects, including damage, healing, and paralysis.
